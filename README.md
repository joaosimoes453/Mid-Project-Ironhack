# Analyzing Potential Risks Posed by Far-Right and Populist Movements in Portugal

# Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my mid-project in the Data Analyst Bootcamp at Ironhack Lisboa! In this project, I have analyzed the potential risks posed by far-right and populist movements in Portugal. The analysis focuses on understanding the socio-political landscape, identifying key factors contributing to the rise of these movements, and evaluating the potential impact on the country's political stability.

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore and understand the factors contributing to the rise of far-right and populist movements in Europe, with a specific focus on Portugal. By analyzing various socio-political variables, my aim is to identify potential risks and challenges these movements pose to the country's political stability and social fabric. Through this analysis, I seek to gain insights into the drivers behind the growth of these movements and their implications for Portugal's socio-political landscape.

# Data Sources
To conduct this analysis, I utilized the following data sources:

1. Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database)
2. The World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/country/EU)
3. Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/)

# Methodology
The analysis for this project involved the following steps:

1. Data Collection: I gathered relevant socio-political and economic data, including population demographics, election results, and economic indicators of far-right and populist movements in Portugal and other European countries such as GDP, unemployment rates, inflation rates, and other relevant economic indicators. 
2. Data Preprocessing: I cleaned and transformed the collected data to ensure consistency and compatibility for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the variables.
4. Comparative Analysis: I compared the socio-political and economic variables associated with far-right and populist movements in Portugal with those in other European countries. By examining these variables across different countries, I aimed to identify commonalities and differences in the factors driving the rise of these movements.
5. Visualization: I created visual representations of the data using charts, graphs, and maps to facilitate understanding and present findings effectively. To accomplish this, I utilized Tableau.
6. Insights and Conclusion: I summarized the key insights derived from the analysis and provided an evaluation of the potential risks and challenges posed by far-right and populist movements in Europe, focusing specifically on the case of Portugal.
I appreciate the collaborative nature of this project and welcome contributions and input from others.
